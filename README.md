# Monitoring Non-Steady-State Activities Using LSTM and LDA
The purpose of this project is to continuously classify non-steady-state activities of participants on a terrian park circuit (shown below) using LSTM and LDA. A) “Terrain park” circuit setup was comprised of a four-step staircase, a ramp and elevated platforms. Subjects performed trials of the circuit in the following orders: They started at point A, performed the locomotion as shown, and stopped at point B. They executed the tasks in the reverse order in the next trial, starting at point B and ending at point A. Circuit trials were performed for both left leading and right leading legs. B) Sixty-six reflective markers were attached to anatomical body locations to track 12 body segments of the arms, legs and torso.Biomechanical data including linear acceleration and angular velocity of upper and lower-body segments were extracted from motion data and were used as system inputs.
