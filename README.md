# Activity-Monitoring-Using-LSTM
The purpose of this project is to continuously classify non-steady-state activities on a terrian park circuit (shown below) of participants using LSTM. Biomechanical data including linear acceleration and angular velocity of upper and lower-body segments were extracted from motion data and were used as system inputs.
